Increase traffic, engage users, and improve revenue with easy-to-install social tools that give you control of your audience data.

== Description ==

= Krux Social =
Krux Social protects privacy through data-safe sharing and drives traffic growth by connecting your audience with their social networks.  And its robust analytics let you identify your most active and most valuable social sharers, monitor social activity over time, and understand how that activity drives business growth.

Expand reach and engagement by leveraging your users' network of friends on Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Pinterest, and LinkedIn.

= Why data-safe matters =
There are many options out there for social sharing, but few people realize that most of the companies that provide those solutions only do so to gain access to valuable information about your users. Those companies rely on the adoption of their 'free' social sharing tools to build vast web-wide user profile databases. They use the data they collect to power ad targeting businesses, and sometimes, they even sell the data itself.

Rarely, if ever, do the websites that provide all that data see any compensation. At Krux, that's bad for users and bad for website operators. Through Krux Social, we give you data-safe solutions for social sharing, and the information that is collected is put to use helping you - not someone else - build a better business.

We've included the top five performers - Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Pinterest, and LinkedIn, and we'll add more if you want more. Let's face it, nobody needs a bunch of tools that their users rarely or never use. Let's keep it simple and valuable.

= More free apps =
The good news doesn't stop here. We've included several other apps to compliment the social widget and help you grow traffic and revenue while protecting your site data and maintaining fast page load times. We know how difficult it can be to setup and maintain a website, and Krux Apps is here to simplify your life. The social features are available within the WordPress admin tool, and additional apps are accessible via the Krux Apps platform.

If you've setup the social widget, then the additional tools are already setup and ready for you to use. http://dataconsole.kruxdigital.com/krux_apps
